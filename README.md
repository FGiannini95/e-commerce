# Payload E-Commerce Template
Learn how to build an incredible e-commerce webshop with an admin dashboard and CMS using Next 14, Stripe, TypeScript, and Payload CMS. This is the official Payload E-Commerce Template. Use it to power e-commerce businesses and online stores of all sizes. Basic role-based access control is set up to determine what users can and cannot do based on their roles. Payload itself handles no currency exchange. All payments are processed and billed using Stripe. This means you must have access to a Stripe account via an API key.
